# World Settlement & Locations

A reference guide to major worlds, settlements, and planetary locations in Asimov's Robots, Empire, and Foundation universe.

## Spacer Worlds

- **Aurora**: First Spacer world, closest to Earth. Originally named New Earth, in later millennia the planet would be renamed "Aurora", which means "dawn", to signify the dawning of a new age for the Spacer culture. It is an Earthlike planet, the innermost planet orbiting the star Tau Ceti (12 LY from Sol). It was the first Spacer planet colonized, established in 2065. Its capital is Eon (approx. 20,000 habitants). As it was highly populated and developed, it was considered the "capital" of the Spacers.
- **Solaria**: Settled c. 3200 C.E. Known for extreme isolation, low human population, and a vast robot workforce. By 25,066 C.E. (the time of "Foundation and Earth"), Solaria was found abandoned by its human population, with only robots and a few genetically modified Solarians remaining underground. Its disappearance from the galactic map marks the end of the Spacer worlds as a major force.
- **Sirius**: One of the original fifty Spacer worlds, Sirius is often mentioned as a powerful and influential Spacer planet. Its location is not specified, but it is named after the brightest star in Earth's sky. *Speculative settlement: c. 2100–2200 C.E., as part of the first wave of Spacer colonization.*
- **Arcturus**: Another of the original Spacer worlds, Arcturus is referenced as a significant member of the Spacer community. Its star is a red giant about 37 light-years from Earth. *Speculative settlement: c. 2100–2200 C.E.*
- **Alpha**: A Spacer world, sometimes confused with Alpha Centauri, but its exact location is not specified. It is one of the original fifty Spacer planets. *Speculative settlement: c. 2100–2200 C.E.*
- **Beta**: Another Spacer world, with little canonical detail beyond its inclusion among the original fifty. *Speculative settlement: c. 2100–2200 C.E.*

## Earth & Colonies

- **Earth**: Origin of humanity, later made radioactive by the events of "Robots and Empire." Once the center of human civilization, it becomes marginalized and shunned by the Spacers and later the Empire.
- **BaleyWorld**: Colony founded after the second wave of emigration, named in honor of Elijah Baley. It represents a new beginning for Earth's descendants. *Speculative founding: c. 3505–3600 C.E., after the second wave of emigration.*
- **Alpha (colony)**: A world settled after the evacuation of Earth, not to be confused with the Spacer world Alpha. Details are sparse, but it is one of the new human colonies. *Speculative founding: c. 3700–4000 C.E.*

## Empire Worlds

- **Trantor**: Capital of the Galactic Empire, located near the galactic center. A planet-wide city, Trantor is the administrative and cultural heart of the Empire for thousands of years. *Became capital: c. 12,000 C.E.*
- **Rhodia**: A major world in the "Nebular Kingdoms," featured in "The Currents of Space." Known for its political intrigue and struggle for independence from the Empire. *Speculative rise: c. 11,000–12,000 C.E.*
- **Nebular Kingdoms**: A group of semi-autonomous worlds on the Empire's periphery, including Rhodia. They play a key role in the transition from the Empire to the Foundation era. *Speculative formation: c. 11,000–12,000 C.E.*

## Foundation Worlds

- **Gaia**: A unique world where all living and non-living things share a group consciousness. Central to the events of "Foundation's Edge." Gaia is located in the Sayshell Sector. *Speculative founding: c. 24,900–25,000 C.E.*
- **Terminus**: Home of the First Foundation, located at the edge of the galaxy. Chosen for its isolation, Terminus becomes the center of science and psychohistory after the fall of Trantor. *Foundation established: 12,067 G.E. / 24,567 C.E.*
- **Anacreon**: One of the Four Kingdoms that emerge after the fall of the Empire, Anacreon is a major power in the early Foundation era. *Speculative independence: c. 24,617 C.E.*
- **Kalgan**: A wealthy and influential world, Kalgan becomes a major antagonist during the Mule's rise and the later Foundation period. *Speculative rise: c. 24,800–25,000 C.E.*
